# 2025_draft_lottery_sim

As a Philadelphia 76ers fan, the 2025 NBA Draft Lottery was a rollercoaster. After San Antonio and Dallas jumped to the top 4, it seemed very unlikely that the Sixers would keep their top 6 protected first-round pick. However, just a few picks later, the Sixers were the overwhelming favorite to receive the first overall pick. Inspired by this, I created a 2025 NBA Draft Lottery Simulator that allows the user to see the simulated probabilities for each team to receive each pick, with the option to force a team into a specific pick. This lets the user go back in time to look at the updated odds before each pick or at entirely other scenarios that didn't happen.
